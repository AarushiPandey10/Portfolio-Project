It is the dataset of a U.S. bank customer for getting information on whether this particular customer will leave the bank or not. In this project, I used Advanced Excel to do the analysis. The following conclusions were drawn from the analysis:
1. Females were more likely to churn than males, especially in the age range of 38-57 years.
2. The income was divided into three ranges- Low, Average, and High. Surprisingly income range had no influence on the customer churn rate
3. More the Number of bank product facilities customers is using more was the churn rate
